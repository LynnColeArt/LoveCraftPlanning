# Encrypted Streaming Vector Store Design
## For High-Volume Musical Pattern Learning

[Previous sections remain the same until File Structure]

#### File Structure
```
/vectors
  /active
    - 2024-12-16-0000.encrypted
    - 2024-12-16-0100.encrypted
  /archive
    - 2024-12-15.encrypted
    - 2024-12-14.encrypted
  metadata.encrypted
```

#### Security Layer
- Each partition encrypted with AES-256
- Unique key per user
- Keys stored in secure local keystore
- Metadata encrypted separately
- Zero-knowledge design

#### Encryption Flow
1. Vector data encrypted before disk write
2. Partition headers contain:
   - IV (Initialization Vector)
   - Key identifier
   - Timestamp
   - Checksum

### Usage Example
```python
store = StreamingVectorStore(
    max_memory_mb=1024,
    partition_size=10000,
    archive_after_hours=24,
    encryption_key=user_key
)

# Write encrypted vectors
store.add_vectors(embeddings, metadata)

# Query (automatically decrypts as needed)
results = store.query(
    vector=query_embedding,
    top_k=10,
    include_archived=True
)
```

### Security Benefits
1. Data encrypted at rest
2. Secure key management
3. Partition-level encryption
4. Zero-knowledge architecture
