# Project Setup and Development Notes

## Project Overview
Building an AI music generation system focusing on:
- MIDI-first architecture
- Local processing
- Professional integration
- User control and privacy

## Key Documents
1. Whitepaper: "What If? A New Approach to AI Music Generation"
2. Project Plan (detailed phases and timeline)
3. Technical Architecture Documentation (to be created)

## Core Components to Develop

### MVP Requirements
1. Basic Generation
   - Lyrics + style input
   - Full arrangement output
   - Multi-track MIDI export
   - Audio rendering via Stable Audio + ControlNet

2. MIDI Architecture
   - Clean track separation
   - Professional-grade MIDI data
   - Complete arrangement structure
   - Clear labeling and organization

### Initial Development Focus
1. Core MIDI Processing
   - Build on Magenta foundation
   - Implement basic generation
   - Create export framework
   - Establish quality controls

2. Stable Audio Integration
   - ControlNet implementation
   - Basic rendering pipeline
   - Quality assurance system

## Next Steps
1. Set up development environment
   - Required dependencies
   - Testing framework
   - Documentation system

2. Begin MIDI foundation
   - Start with Magenta integration
   - Implement basic processing
   - Create test suite

3. Prototype generation pipeline
   - Basic style control
   - MIDI output structure
   - Initial quality checks

4. Document everything
   - Technical specifications
   - API documentation
   - User guides

## Future Reference Points
1. Track tablature integration plans
2. Monitor developments in foundation models
3. Keep privacy/ethical considerations central
4. Maintain focus on user control and agency

## Important Concepts to Remember
- Balance between accessibility and power
- Importance of clean MIDI structure
- Focus on empowering users
- Commitment to ethical development
- Value of local processing

Remember: This is about expanding possibilities in music creation, not replacing existing tools.

## Research Areas
1. Magenta fine-tuning capabilities
2. ControlNet optimization
3. Tablature processing methods
4. MIDI cleaning techniques
5. DAW integration approaches

## Community Engagement
- Plan for GPL3 license implementation
- Consider contribution guidelines
- Think about documentation needs
- Plan for issue tracking
