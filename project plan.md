# AI Music Generation System Project Plan - v3

## Project Vision
To create an open, flexible music generation system that bridges the gap between traditional music production and AI capabilities. Our goal is to develop a system that serves both AI enthusiasts and professional musicians by providing unprecedented control over AI music generation through MIDI integration and professional-grade tools.

## Why This Matters
Current AI music generation tools like Suno and Udio, while powerful, have limitations that this project aims to address:
- Limited control over musical structure and composition
- Lack of deep MIDI integration for professional workflows
- Difficulties with precise emotional expression in vocals
- Challenges in making targeted modifications to generated content
- Limited integration with professional music production tools

## MVP (Core Features)
1. **Basic Generation**
   - Input: lyrics + single style/genre selection
   - Internal: MIDI-based architecture
   - Full song arrangement generation
   - Style affects both composition and rendering

2. **Multi-Track MIDI Export**
   - Separate tracks for each instrument
   - Complete drum pattern separation
   - Clear track labeling and organization
   - Full arrangement structure preserved
   - Professional-grade MIDI data

3. **Audio Output**
   - Full song rendering via Stable Audio + ControlNet
   - Basic quality control
   - Simple mixing/mastering
   - Basic export options

4. **Essential Controls**
   - Single unified style/genre selection
   - Basic arrangement parameters
   - Simple quality settings
   - Export format options

## Immediate Post-MVP Priorities
1. **Enhanced Style Control**
   - Split into arrangement and rendering styles
   - Arrangement style controls composition
   - Optional independent rendering style
   - Default rendering matches arrangement style
   - Genre fusion capabilities

2. **Input Expansion**
   - MIDI file import capability
   - WAV file transcription
   - Basic tablature support
   - Simple MIDI editing

3. **Enhanced Control**
   - Extended style options
   - Basic arrangement modification
   - Simple track editing
   - Enhanced quality controls
