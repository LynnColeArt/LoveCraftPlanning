# Love Craft

An open source conversational music generation project based on public domain data.

You'll have to excuse me while I figure this out. You see, this particular project is impossible at the moment.

The things I'm proposing in the documentation here can't be done. It's not a limitation of neural nets or the way AI works.

Actually, and in fact, it's a problem with the way music notation works.

So you're going to have to bear with me while I reinvent what music is.

We should be back up and running soon.

Love ya!
