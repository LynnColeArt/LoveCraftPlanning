# LLM-Based Music Processing: Pattern Recognition to Notation Generation

## Core Concept
LLMs can directly process musical data by understanding:
- Mathematical relationships in music
- Genre patterns and transformations
- Notation systems and rules
- Musical theory and structure

## Data Structure 
```json
{
  "piece": {
    "original": {
      "json": "[MIDI/JSON data]",
      "abc": "X:1\nT:Example\n...",
      "features": {
        "intervals": [2,2,3,2],
        "rhythm_ratios": [1,0.5,0.25],
        "harmony": ["I","V","IV","I"]
      }
    },
    "variations": [
      {
        "style": "jazz",
        "abc": "[transformed notation]",
        "transform_patterns": {
          "intervals": "expanded by 1.5",
          "harmony": "added sevenths"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Training Approach
1. Feed parallel representations to LLM
2. Train on relationships between:
   - Musical features
   - Genre characteristics
   - Valid transformations
   - Notation systems

## Generation Process
1. LLM analyzes input constraints
2. Applies learned patterns
3. Generates valid ABC notation
4. Validates against musical rules

## Benefits
- Direct pattern understanding
- No intermediate processing
- Faster generation
- Better theoretical grasp
- Lower computational overhead

## Applications
- Style transfer
- Genre fusion
- Notation generation
- Music theory analysis
- Composition assistance
